Hi there, I am a Software Engineer originally from Barcelona working at [Slack](https://slack.com/) in San Francisco.

I write [Gray Matters ðŸ§ ](https://graymatters.substack.com/) with Mario Chamorro, a weekly newsletter about Tech, Productivity and the "New Normal". I also have other articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@gamell), mostly [rants about Software Development](https://medium.com/hackernoon/you-have-to-choose-between-software-delivered-on-time-and-good-software-44f4af1249b1). You can find my latest writings  [below](#articles).

I love photography! I have some **[showcased photography collections](https://photo.gamell.io)**, and if you [scroll down](#photography) you will find my latests posts to [instagram]([url](https://instagram.com/jgamell)). I should post more often. Oh well.

Lastly, you can also check out my [coding projects](#projects) or [my resume & contact information](#contact) towards the bottom. Thanks for stopping by, I really appreciate it. You can see yourself out when you're done.
